Emulationstation theme for retropie 
 
This theme is loosely based on David Marti's Showcase theme so credits to him. 
 
NOTE: 
I recommend placing the theme folder in "/opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/themes" folder so you don't need root 
access to add, remove, or manipulate any part of it. 
 
NOTE: 
Now I made this theme for my personal build so not all systems a supported. I started working on additional systems but 
unfortunately my HDD died on me and I lost all the master files. This means that I probably won't be supporting it any 
time soon so I decided to share it as is. 
 
SUPPORTED SYSTEMS: 
 
arcade, fba, gb, gba, gbc, genesis, gg, mastersystem, megadrive, n64, nds, nes, psx, saturn, segacd, snes, tg16 and tg16cd.
